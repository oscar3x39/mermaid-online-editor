## 🛠 Project Structure

The project follows modern Vue.js best practices with a modular architecture:

```text
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/       # Styles & static assets
│   ├── components/   # Modular UI components (Toolbar, CookieBanner, etc.)
│   ├── composables/  # Logic extraction (useHistory, useUndoRedo, useUrlState, useMermaid)
│   ├── constants/    # Fixed data (Translations, Examples)
│   ├── App.vue       # Main entry point (Clean reactive logic)
│   └── main.js       # App initialization
├── Dockerfile        # Optimized build recipe
└── .dockerignore     # Build context filtering
```

## 🔐 Privacy & Sharing

We value your privacy. This application is **stateless on the backend**. 
- Diagrams are stored in **your browser's local storage**.
- Shared links are generated by compressing your code into a URL hash.
- **No diagram data is ever sent to or stored on our servers.**
